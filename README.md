# wtf aws

### Goal

Would like this to be a compilation of behaviors in AWS that are surprising and interesting. These should be about design decisions in AWS that can be described in a short paragraph, not one off bugs or complicated issues that can't easily be summed up.

I feel like when I read lists like this for programming languages you end up getting a bit better idea how the language really works behind the scenes, so if people where able to read this and feel like they have a better idea of how AWS really works I think that would be pretty cool. But this goal is somewhat secondary to the list simply being interesting to read.

#### Ideas
* AWS resource policy magic (ARN <-> AROA conversions)
  * Convert AROA to arn's (ref: https://twitter.com/__steele/status/1433212318465159171?s=20)
  * Enumerating valid ARN's (ref: bunch of stuff)
